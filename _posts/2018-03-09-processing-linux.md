## Using Processing on Linux

I end up using derivatives of Ubuntu most of the time, so this should help with the install process.


[Installing Processing 3.x on Ubuntu Linux Systems](http://www.artsnova.com/processing/installing-processing-ubuntu-linux-tutorial.html).

A few modifications need to be made for Elementary OS, for ex. there is need to use both sudo and su while moving to /usr/local/bin

Also, I tend to use nano just because I like it better. Still havent been able to make the mime type work well. Hopefully that will change soon.
