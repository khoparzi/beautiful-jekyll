Following instructions from Blokas labs excellent Mode-P and Pi-sound projects.

[Headless Pi start to finish](https://community.blokas.io/t/headless-pi-start-to-finish/612)

[Installing supercollider on RPi](https://community.blokas.io/t/music-software-supercollider/618)

This second post is great as it describes both methods, installing from apt-get as well as building from source (always trips up linux newbies [which I still seem to be even after 12-13 years of using it in some capacity or other]).

Well, between the Jetson and this RPi setup, we should soon have a SBC powered AV setup for performances that can be driven by OSC messages.
